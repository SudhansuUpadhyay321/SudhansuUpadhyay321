So I am currently learning python programming not coding but programming I have known python for like a year now but then I realized that I just know pythong and don't really 
how to program so right now I am learning python programming and also javascript basics I know how to code or program in css but am learning python and I like python kinda.
If you are a recruiter or someone look for people to hire and you see this I am ready to get hired and learn under you and work for you in the future I would like it even more 
if you are from Europe. I want to move to Europe there is this one girl I want to meet and have a nice future with her so if you are a recruiter or a company owner who want people 
to work consider me I am ready to learn any techonology I am asked to given enough time also since it's me who want to go there meaning I will work as hard as I can so you can
trust me
Thank you for giving your valuable time to read this thing here!
